# SSID Probing and Bruteforcing

## Intro

This is used in case we don't know the **ssid** of an AP.

### Concept

* Probes APs and checks for answer, useful for checking if SSID has been correctly decloaked and if AP is in your sending range.&#x20;
* **Bruteforcing of hidden SSIDs** with or without a wordlist is also available.
* However, hiding is not always the best option to prevent attacks from happening because even while hidden an attacker can capture encrypted frames in monitor mode and know the SSID.

```
# Here, weâ€™d use the bruteforce technique against the target AP using mdk3.
mdk3 wlan0mon p -b l -c 6 -t '<BSSID>'
```
