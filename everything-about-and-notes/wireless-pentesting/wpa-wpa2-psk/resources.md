### Wifite

This tool gets the **closest AP** and start attacking it, just using one single command. The attacks that automate are:

* **WEP (Launches WEP attacks)**
* **WPA/WPA2 - PSK**
  * **The Capture of the WPA Handshake**
  * **PMKID attacks (remember, to be successful with it, the AP need to have roaming mode on)**
  * **WPS**&#x20;
    * **Pixie dust attack and the brute force attack (Can take a long time so get that in mind)**
    * **If PMKID or Handshake, the tool tries to brute forced with a top5000 passwords wordlist.**
