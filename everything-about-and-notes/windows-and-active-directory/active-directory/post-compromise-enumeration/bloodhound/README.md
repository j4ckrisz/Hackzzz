# Bloodhound

* **BloodHound** is a tool used to **visualize** and **identify** attack paths in Active Directory Domains. Being that AD is Windows based, some of the default tools for BloodHound (ie. **SharpHound ingestor**) only run-on Windows.
* Fortunately, there are tools for Unix-like systems that allow us to easily work with BloodHound on Kali and other Linux machines.
