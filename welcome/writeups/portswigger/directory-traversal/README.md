# ðŸªœ Directory Traversal

## What is Directory Traversal?

* Is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to _**read arbitrary files**_ and also might be able to _**write to arbitrary** files_ on the server that is running an application.

### What might include:

* Application Code and Data
* Credentials for back-end systems
* Sensitive operating system files

### Quick Example:

* The application implements no defenses against directory traversal attacks, so an attacker can request the following URL **to retrieve an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem:**

```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd
```
