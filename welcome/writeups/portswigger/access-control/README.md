# üóÉÔ∏è Access Control

* **Access control (or authorization)** is the application of constraints on who (or what) can perform attempted actions or access resources that they have requested.
* Broken access controls are a commonly encountered and **often critical security vulnerability.**

From a user perspective, access controls can be divided into the following 3 categories:

1. **Vertical access controls -** Vertical access controls are mechanisms that restrict access to sensitive functionality that is not available to other types of users.
2. **Horizontal access controls -** Horizontal access controls are mechanisms that restrict access to resources to the users who are specifically allowed to access those resources.
3. **Context-dependent access controls -** Context-dependent access controls restrict access to functionality and resources based upon the state of the application or the user's interaction with it.
