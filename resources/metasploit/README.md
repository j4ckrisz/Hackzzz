# ðŸŸ¦ Metasploit

**Port Scanning**

Metasploit has a number of modules to scan open ports on the target system and network. You can list potential port scanning modules available using the `search portscan` command.



**UDP service Identification**

The `scanner/discovery/udp_sweep` module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). As you can see below, this module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS

**SMB Scans**

Metasploit offers several useful auxiliary modules that allow us to scan specific services. Below is an example for the SMB. Especially useful in a corporate network would be `smb_enumshares` and `smb_version` but please spend some time to identify scanners that the Metasploit version installed on your system offers.
